# ez mq  
### Never type rabbitmq rabbitmq again  

## Features  

**ez mq** is designed to enhance the efficiency of working with RabbitMQ pages by bypassing the redundant login screen across all environments. Below is a detailed overview of its key features:  

### 1. Auto-Login  
- Automatically fills in and submits login credentials for RabbitMQ environments, eliminating the need to repeatedly enter them.  
- Credentials are securely stored using Chrome's local storage, ensuring privacy and easy access.  
- Can be enabled or disabled at any time via the extension popup for flexibility.  

### 2. Environment Labeling  
- Dynamically detects and labels the current RabbitMQ environment (e.g., **LEVI Stage 2, GXOL Prod**).  
- Displays the environment label prominently at the top of the page for quick reference.  
- Ensures users always know which instance they are working in, reducing accidental operations in the wrong environment.  

### 3. Recently Visited RabbitMQs  
- Tracks and displays the last **12 unique RabbitMQ environments** youâ€™ve accessed.  
- Provides a quick-access section in the popup, allowing users to instantly navigate between frequently used instances.

## Usage Guide  

### Auto-Login & Environment Labeling  
- As soon as **ez mq** is installed, these features **automatically take effect** when accessing any RabbitMQ environment.  
- The extension detects RabbitMQ login pages and **bypasses the login screen** by auto-filling saved credentials and submitting the form.  
- If credentials are stored, the login process is seamless, reducing the time spent manually logging in.  
- The **environment label** is dynamically extracted from the RabbitMQ URL and displayed at the top of the page, providing clear context on which instance youâ€™re working in (e.g., **LEVI Stage 2**, **GXOL Prod**).  
- No setup is requiredâ€”just install **ez mq** and start using RabbitMQ pages more efficiently.
